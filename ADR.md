# Change the Background Color of the Website

## Context
The previous background color (white) was too bright, making it hard for users to comfortably read the content. A more appealing color scheme was needed to improve user engagement and overall user experience.

## Decision
The background color of the page was changed from white to a green, aiming to create a more visually appealing and user-friendly experience.

## Justification
Green is a calming color that aligns with psychological studies on user behavior, suggesting it could keep visitors on the page longer. It also matches the theme of the website better than the previous color. The decision was based on user feedback and the need to make the website stand out.

## Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - The website now looks more professional and appealing.
  - Increased user engagement and positive feedback have been observed.
- **Negative**:
  - Additional monitoring of user feedback is required to ensure the change is well-received.
  - Future updates may need to consider color contrast for accessibility compliance.
